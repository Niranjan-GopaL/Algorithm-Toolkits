A couple of people wanted  to know how essays can be improved.

Many or even most of the points that pertain to the Structure part of individual presentations, also apply to writing an essay - the big difference is, of course, that language skills matter a lot more when you're writing. When you speak, your body language and tone often make up for language deficiencies, but in writing this cannot happen as the essay has no external support! Secondly, this is writing. So, Accuracy, Brevity, Clarity also applies.

1. Take a couple of minutes to understand the topic clearly. e.g. It's not just about what are the changes in your life after coming to college but how has it changed you - your attitudes, your belief systems and of course the practical part of your lives too. In the team Q, its What did you learn about yourselfâ€‹ - not what did you learn. e.g. I have a short fuse and must learn to keep it under control ðŸ™‚

2. Be clear in your mind about your point of view. Don't write like ChatGPT. Write like a human being with your own thoughts and ideas. 

3. Jot down the structure you intend to follow - Intro, points and conclusion. Please remember that the bulk of the essay should be the points. Ideally at least 3.â€‹

4. Make sure that the intro / conclusion isn't disproportionately long. In a 1.5 page essay, intro can't be more than 3 lines. Intros shouldn't explain points.

5. An essay must have paragraphs - each para is similar to a point in PEP. Each para covers a point, preferably with an example. Don't just say this happens in some teams but give an example from your experience (without namesðŸ˜‰) the pause in PEP is equivalent to the break as you go to the next para.

6. Essays, can and should be creative. So if you have a fun comparison, go ahead and make it.

7. Do NOT repeat yourself. This comes across as you just trying to fill up space. 

8. Never send off an essay without reading it through. Remember that language and logical explanation matter! Check to see if what you mean and what you say are the same thing.













------->  ESSAY 



YouTube has revolutionized the way we consume and share video content, enabling millions of users to express 
their creativity and engage with diverse communities. However, this digital landscape has also brought to the
forefront complex issue of copyright infringement. Copyright claims on YouTube have become a common occurrence, 
impacting creators, copyright holders, and the wider online community. 


Case: "Baby Shark" Copyright Claims
"Baby Shark," a catchy children's song, went viral on YouTube, resulting in numerous covers and 
remixes by creators worldwide. However, many creators faced copyright claims from Pinkfong, 
the original copyright holder of the song.

        Determining originality: Pinkfong claimed ownership of the song, but questions arose about the origins 
        of the melody and whether it was in the public domain.

        Fair use considerations: Some creators argued fair use, as they transformed the song through 
        parody or commentary. However, fair use determinations can be subjective and require a case-by-case 
        analysis.




Case: Nintendo Game Content Claims
Description: Many YouTubers who create gameplay videos or reviews of Nintendo games face copyright claims 
from Nintendo. These claims often result in demonetization or removal of the affected videos.

        Content ownership: Nintendo holds copyright over its games, including visual and audio elements. 
        Using substantial portions of gameplay footage or music without explicit permission may infringe on those rights.

        Transformative nature: Some argue that gameplay commentary, critique, or transformative editing constitute 
        fair use. However, the extent of transformative elements and the impact on the market value of the original 
        game are factors to be considered




These cases illustrate the complexities of copyright infringement on YouTube, involving issues of ownership, 
fair use, transformative works, and the impact on market value. Each case requires careful examination of the specific 
circumstances and applicable laws to determine the outcome. It highlights the 
ongoing challenges faced by creators in navigating copyright issues while expressing their creativity on the platform.









Impacts on Creators:
YouTube copyright claims can significantly impact creators' ability to monetize their content and reach their audience. 
Videos flagged for copyright infringement may be subject to content removal, demonetization, or blocking in specific regions. 
These consequences can be disheartening for creators who rely on YouTube for income and recognition. Some argue that the current 
copyright enforcement mechanisms lack nuance, resulting in unintended penalties for fair use and transformative works.





YouTube copyright claims present a delicate balance between the protection of intellectual property rights and 
fostering creativity and expression. Striking this balance requires continuous dialogue, legal clarity, and technological advancements.Improved algorithms and fair use education can help reduce erroneous copyright claims and empower creators to produce transformative content. Collaboration between creators, copyright holders, and platforms can lead to mutually beneficial partnerships that respect copyright while promoting creativity and innovation. As the digital landscape evolves, it is essential to find equitable solutions that encourage responsible content sharing, protect rights, and support the vibrant creative community on YouTube.
